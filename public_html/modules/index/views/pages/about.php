  <h3 class="my-2">SAINT STORY</h3>
  <p>A lash appointment is probably one of the few treatments I used to look forward to. Most beauty treatments like hair removal included pain that I had to brace myself for.
    Lash appointments on the other hand were a chance for a well deserved nap. A nap that just gets better when you wake up and look in the mirror and feel 10 times better than when you walked in.
    No pain, I didn't need to move a muscle to feel better.</p>
  <p>Before I knew it I was so intrigued by the lash industry that I had become a lash addict. I had my appointments booked months in advance.
    I started to experiment with different styles and lengths, my lash tech was an angel from lash heaven who knew how to achieve any look. I admired the art and was inspired.</p>
  <p>Three years of studying the science of lash extensions, courses with some of the UK's most experienced lash educators, a few epic fails and tons more practising,
    I was finally ready to quit my full time job to pursue my passion and Saint Lashes was born.</p>
  <p>It wasn't just the service itself that was important. I wanted every woman who is Saint client to experience a little piece of heaven in the studio.
    The surroundings had to be decorated to feel luxurious and peaceful, somewhere you look forward to going. My on going dream is for Saint Lashes to always be consistent in
    the highest quality products and services so every time you leave with a little spring in your step.</p>

  <p>Owner of Saint Lashes</p>
